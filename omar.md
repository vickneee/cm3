# Self-Assessment (Template)

### Example 1: Testing Job CRUD Operations

Initially, the API routes for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting jobs were implemented,but we needed thorough testing to ensure proper functionality, 
especially for edge cases. Here's an overview of the original setup:

```javascript
// Testing Job Creation, Update, Deletion, and Retrieval API Routes
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const supertest = require("supertest");
const app = require("../app"); // Express app
const Job = require("../models/jobModel");
const User = require("../models/userModel");

// Supertest agent
const api = supertest(app);

const jobs = [
  {
    title: "Software Engineer",
    type: "Full-Time",
    description: "Develop and maintain web applications using modern technologies.",
    company: {
      name: "Tech Solutions Inc.",
      contactEmail: "hr@techsolutions.com",
      contactPhone: "+1234567890",
      website: "https://techsolutions.com"
    },
    location: "Remote",
    salary: 120000,
    postedDate: "2021-01-01",
    status: "open",
    applicationDeadline: "2021-02-01",
    requirements: ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"],
  },
  // Other job objects...
];

let token = null;

beforeAll(async () => {
  await User.deleteMany({});
  const result = await api.post("/api/users/signup").send({
    name: "Sara Smith",
    username: "sara_smith89",
    password: "myp@ssword123",
    phone_number: "987-654-3210",
    gender: "Female",
    date_of_birth: "1989-11-22",
    membership_status: "Silver",
    bio: "Passionate about design and photography.",
    address: "456 Oak Avenue, Springfield",
    profile_picture: "https://example.com/sara-profile.png"
  });
  token = result.body.token;
});
```
In this initial implementation, I set up the jobs array and initialized the testing environment. Then, I proceeded to write the tests for various job operations like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting jobs.

### Key Improvements:
1. Testing Job Creation (POST /api/jobs):

Originally, there was no formal test for job creation. I added a test to verify that when a valid request is sent, the job is created correctly.

```javascript
it("should create one job when POST /api/jobs is called", async () => {
  const newJob = {
    title: "Software Engineer",
    type: "Full-time",
    description: "We are looking for a skilled software engineer to join our team and build high-quality software solutions.",
    company: {
      name: "Tech Innovators Ltd.",
      contactEmail: "hr@techinnovators.com",
      contactPhone: "123-456-7890",
      website: "https://www.techinnovators.com",
      size: 500
    },
    location: "Helsinki, Finland",
    salary: 60000,
    experienceLevel: "Mid",
    postedDate: "2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z",
    status: "open",
    applicationDeadline: "2025-04-07T00:00:00.000Z",
    requirements: ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"]
  };

  await api
    .post("/api/jobs")
    .set("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)
    .send(newJob)
    .expect(201);
});
```
This test ensures that when the correct data is sent via a POST request, a job is successfully created in the system. 

2. Testing Job Update (PUT /api/jobs/:id):

I added a test for updating a job by its ID to ensure that the job data can be modified successfully:


```javascript
it("should update one job by ID when PUT /api/jobs/:id is called", async () => {
  const job = await Job.findOne();
  const updatedJob = {
    title: "Updated job information.",
    type: "Remote",
  };

  const response = await api
    .put(`/api/jobs/${job._id}`)
    .set("Authorization", "bearer " + token)
    .send(updatedJob)
    .expect(200)
    .expect("Content-Type", /application\/json/);

  const updatedJobCheck = await Job.findById(job._id);
  expect(updatedJobCheck.title).toBe(updatedJob.title);
  expect(updatedJobCheck.type).toBe(updatedJob.type);
});
```
This test ensures that after sending a PUT request with updated data, the job details in the database are modified as expected.

**Lessons Learned:**

1. **Comprehensive Testing:** Initially, I only had basic routes but learned the importance of testing edge cases like creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting resources in API endpoints.
2. **Authorization Handling:** By using a token for authorization, I ensured that only authorized users could perform the job-related actions, which mimics real-world scenarios. 

3. **Test Automation:** The importance of running these automated tests cannot be overstated. They provide confidence that changes to the API won't break existing functionality.

### Example 2: Debugging Route Syntax

There was a subtle error in the PUT request's route handling syntax. The incorrect syntax caused the test to fail:

```js
const response = await api
  .put(/api/jobs/${job._id})  // Incorrect syntax
  .set("Authorization", "bearer " + token)
  .send(updatedJob)
  .expect(200);

```

The correct syntax is to wrap the URL inside a template literal:

```js
const response = await api
  .put(`/api/jobs/${job._id}`)  // Correct syntax
  .set("Authorization", "bearer " + token)
  .send(updatedJob)
  .expect(200);
```

This fix ensured the correct path was used for the PUT request, which made the test pass.
